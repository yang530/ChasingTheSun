This is a mini web game powered by ZIMjs - https://zimjs.com/.

## Background:

"Kuafu decided to chase and catch the Sun, He followed the Sun from the East to the West.
While he was passing thru the river of Wei (a branch of the yellow river), he drank the 
entire river to quench his burning thirst. However, the great river was unable to satiate
his need for water. He ran on towards north, eventually died of thirst and exhaustion."
	
(Story in Chinese: 夸父与日逐走，入日； 渴，欲得饮，饮于河、渭； 河、渭不足，北饮大泽。未至，道渴而死。
弃其杖，化为邓林。--山海经)
